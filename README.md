# Reactify

**A homemade Spotify web client built with React and Redux.**

This project aims to be as feature complete as possible, utilizing the Spotify web API to allow access to your user profile, artist profiles, albums, searching and browsing, as well as personalization through playlist creation and editing, and the ability to follow or unfollow artists and playlists. 

It uses the Spotify Web Playback SDK to allow full audio playback when the browser supports it, but still falls back to the 30 second previews in browsers that aren't compatible with the SDK.
